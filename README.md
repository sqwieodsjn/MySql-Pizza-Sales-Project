# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis – SQL Project

This project focuses on performing end-to-end **SQL-based data analysis** on a Pizza Sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights.
The goal is to understand sales patterns, revenue distribution, top-performing pizzas, and customer buying behavior using structured SQL queries.

## 📚 Project Overview

This SQL project is divided into **three difficulty levels**:

* **Basic** – Simple aggregations and retrievals
* **Intermediate** – Multi-table joins and grouped analysis
* **Advanced** – Revenue contribution, cumulative analysis, and ranking

The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to solve real-world business questions in the food & beverage domain.

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of four relational tables:

| Table Name        | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **orders**        | Contains order timestamps and order IDs       |
| **order_details** | Includes pizza ID and quantity for each order |
| **pizzas**        | Includes pizza size, price, and pizza ID      |
| **pizza_types**   | Contains pizza category and name              |

These tables are joined using primary & foreign key relationships to perform meaningful analysis.
